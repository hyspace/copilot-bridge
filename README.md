> Use GitHub Copilot as a local OpenAI/Anthropic-compatible API, so [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli), [Codex App](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app), [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) and Continue can talk to Copilot with minimal configuration.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is an unofficial bridge for the GitHub Copilot API and may break if the
> upstream API changes.

## Why this bridge?

copilot-bridge is more than a raw HTTP proxy:

1. **Codex CLI, Codex App, and Claude support.** Exposes Codex `/v1/responses`,
   Claude Code `/v1/messages`, and OpenAI-compatible chat, embeddings, and
   models routes.
2. **Tool call compatibility.** Adapts MCP tool names and tool call payloads to each upstream model's constraints, then restores the original tool identity for the client. This keeps real Claude Code and Codex CLI agent workflows working when MCP plugins expose long or model-incompatible tool names.
3. **Web search support.** Model-selected web search can be executed by the
   bridge and fed back into a final model pass.
4. **End-to-end reasoning support.** Normalizes model aliases and
   `reasoning_effort`, routes through the right upstream API, and preserves
   returned `reasoning_text` / `reasoning_content` in streaming and
   non-streaming responses.

## Install & run

```sh
# one-time GitHub device login
npx betahi-copilot-bridge@latest auth

# start the bridge on 127.0.0.1:4142
npx betahi-copilot-bridge@latest start
```

After startup the banner prints a **Usage Viewer** link of the form
`https://betahi.github.io/copilot-bridge?endpoint=http://127.0.0.1:4142/usage`,
which renders the Copilot quota snapshot (chat / completions / premium
interactions) read from `GET /usage`.

The bridge exposes both adapter-style endpoints (`/v1/responses`,
`/v1/messages`) and the raw OpenAI-compatible surface
(`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/embeddings`, `/v1/models`) so tools like
LiteLLM, Continue, Cline and Aider work out of the box. CORS is enabled
globally for browser-based clients.

## Configure Codex CLI or Codex App

Codex CLI and Codex App use the same provider config in
**`~/.codex/config.toml`**. `start` writes a managed block into that file. You
don't edit between the markers; the bridge regenerates that block on every
start. To pin the **default model** for Codex clients, add your top-level keys
above the managed block:

```toml
# User defaults; edit these freely.
model = "gpt-5.3-codex"
model_reasoning_effort = "high"

# >>> copilot-bridge managed block — auto-generated, do not edit between markers >>>
model_provider = "bridge"
model_supports_reasoning_summaries = true

[model_providers.bridge]
name = "Copilot Bridge"
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:4142/v1"
wire_api = "responses"
supports_websockets = false
requires_openai_auth = false
# <<< copilot-bridge managed block — edits outside this block are preserved <<<
```

Use `--no-codex-setup` to skip this writer if you manage
`~/.codex/config.toml` yourself.

Codex model discovery requests (`/v1/models?client_version=...`) receive a
native Codex model catalog, generated from your account's available Copilot
models. No per-model entries are needed in `config.toml`. This also lets new
Responses models, such as `gpt-6-astra`, appear in the picker without a static
bridge allowlist. Plain `/v1/models` requests keep the OpenAI-compatible format.
Only enabled, picker-visible tool-calling models that the bridge can route are
advertised.

The managed config also keeps Codex CLI's `/status` context-window display in
sync with Copilot model metadata. For example, GPT-5.5 shows a 1.05M context
window through the bridge:

![Codex context window](assets/screenshots/codex_2.png)

### Codex warning: "Model metadata ... not found"

This is a Codex client-side metadata warning, not a bridge routing failure, requests can still complete through the bridge.

For 1M models, upstream still enforces a 1,000,000-token prompt
limit (about 900k succeeds; around 1,000,046 is rejected as too long).

## Configure Claude Code

`copilot-bridge start` writes `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` and a dummy
`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` into **`~/.claude/settings.json`**. Other settings are
preserved; use `--no-claude-setup` to skip this writer.

Minimal recommended config is:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:4142",
    "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": "dummy",
    "ANTHROPIC_MODEL": "claude-opus-4.7",
    "MODEL_REASONING_EFFORT": "medium"
  }
}
```

For Claude Code 1M context, use the `-[1m]` display form in
`ANTHROPIC_MODEL`. Claude Code shows a 1M context window for this form, and the
bridge maps it to the matching upstream Copilot model:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "ANTHROPIC_MODEL": "claude-opus-4.8-[1m]"
  }
}
```

Slot-specific overrides:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:4142",
    "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": "dummy",
    "ANTHROPIC_MODEL": "claude-opus-4.7",
    "ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL": "claude-sonnet-4.6",
    "ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL": "claude-haiku-4.5",
    "MODEL_REASONING_EFFORT": "medium"
  }
}
```

`MODEL_REASONING_EFFORT` (case-insensitive key lookup) is also read from the
project-local `.claude/settings.json` and `.claude/settings.local.json` and
applied to Claude requests only when the model supports reasoning. If it is not
configured, Claude requests do not infer or attach a reasoning effort.

## Web Search

Not every Copilot model can run web search. Bridge-managed web search is enabled
only when `COPILOT_WEB_SEARCH_BACKEND` is present and points to a supported
backend. If the setting is missing, empty, or names an unsupported backend, the
bridge treats web search as unsupported and passes the model response through
normally.

For Claude Code, configure web search in the user-level
`~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "COPILOT_WEB_SEARCH_BACKEND": "gpt-5.5"
  }
}
```

For Codex CLI, configure the same backend as a top-level key in
`~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
COPILOT_WEB_SEARCH_BACKEND = "gpt-5.5"
```

| Value | Search path | Requirement |
| ----- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Copilot model id, for example `gpt-5.6-luna` | Copilot HTTP `/responses` + `web_search_preview` | Recommended: `gpt-5.6-luna`, `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, `gpt-5.5`, `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, `gpt-5.3-codex`. |
| `searxng`, use `"COPILOT_WEB_SEARCH_BACKEND": "searxng"` | Local SearXNG at `http://localhost:8080` | Start SearXNG yourself. Setup guide: https://github.com/betaHi/openclaw-searxng-search. |
| `copilot-cli` or `copilot`, use `"COPILOT_WEB_SEARCH_BACKEND": "copilot-cli"` | GitHub Copilot CLI `web_search` tool, using the current request model | Install and sign in to GitHub Copilot CLI yourself. |

Project-local Claude settings do not enable bridge-managed web search. Claude
Code reads this setting only from the user-level `~/.claude/settings.json`; Codex
CLI reads it only from the top level of `~/.codex/config.toml`.

When a supported backend is configured, the bridge executes web search only after
the model requests the WebSearch tool. It then sends the search context through a
final model pass, so Claude Code and Codex CLI receive the WebSearch call plus
the model's final reasoning/text response instead of raw search output alone.

The bridge never installs Docker, SearXNG, or Copilot CLI automatically.

## Start flags

Common:

| Flag | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| `--host <host>` | Bind address. Defaults to `127.0.0.1`. |
| `--port <port>` | Listen port. Overrides `$PORT` and the port inferred from Claude settings. |
| `--model <model>` | Override the request model for this bridge process only; does not edit config files. |
| `--auto` | Acquire a Copilot Auto session and attach its session token only to upstream `/chat/completions` and `/responses` requests. Codex model selection is limited to Auto-available models. |
| `--rate-limit <seconds>` | Enforce a minimum delay between upstream requests. |
| `--wait` | With `--rate-limit`, wait instead of returning HTTP 429. |

Codex:

| Flag | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| `--no-codex-setup` | Skip writing the managed block into `~/.codex/config.toml`. |
| `--no-prompt` | Never prompt for a Codex default model. |

Claude:

| Flag | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| `--no-claude-setup` | Skip writing `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` into `~/.claude/settings.json`. |

Diagnostics:

| Flag | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| `--debug` | Print extra upstream error diagnostics. |
| `--show-token` | Print GitHub and Copilot tokens during startup. Sensitive; use only for local debugging. |

`--debug` enables extra upstream error diagnostics in console logs.
- Includes: token limits, stream mode, tool count, invalid tool names, and suspicious tool-schema paths.
- Does not include: request messages, prompt text, bearer tokens, tool descriptions, or the full request body.

**Review or redact debug logs before sharing them publicly.**

### Codex HTTP compatibility

`POST /v1/responses` accepts plain JSON or HTTP `Content-Encoding` values
`gzip`, `deflate`, `br`, and `zstd`. Encodings are decoded before JSON parsing,
in reverse order for stacked encodings (at most four layers). Zstd requires
runtime support in `node:zlib`; older runtimes reject that encoding with 415
instead of failing to start the bridge. The wire body and each decoded layer
are limited to 64 MiB. This is a memory/transport limit, not a token limit.
Malformed compressed data or JSON returns a structured 400, oversized bodies
return 413, and unsupported encodings return 415. Errors never echo request
contents. Client authentication headers are not forwarded to Copilot.

The native Responses SSE normalizer accepts LF, CRLF, and CR line endings,
optional whitespace after `data:`, and multiline data fields. It preserves
Unicode text, private-use citation markers, source metadata and annotations;
it does not invent source URLs or synthesize completion after a truncated
stream. Rebuilt SSE responses drop obsolete body-length, encoding and integrity
headers, while retaining request IDs and retry headers. Cancellation and
upstream stream errors propagate through the normalizer.

This is **not** an implementation of Codex's standalone `/alpha/search` API or
of a citation renderer. The bridge's configured `web_search_backend` implements
search inside Responses requests; it is not the standalone Alpha Search protocol.
Native source/annotation preservation does not guarantee that every Codex UI
will render every citation marker. Missing sources must be diagnosed upstream,
not replaced with guessed links.

For protocol regression tests, run `bun test`. Run `bun run test:http` for an
additional HTTP smoke test using two ephemeral loopback servers and fake tokens
(no real model calls and no changes to user configuration).

## Environment overrides

| Variable                   | Purpose                                              |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `COPILOT_TOKEN`            | Pre-issued Copilot bearer token (skip device login). |
| `COPILOT_ACCOUNT_TYPE`     | `individual` \| `business` \| `enterprise`.          |
| `COPILOT_BASE_URL`         | Override the upstream Copilot base URL.              |
| `COPILOT_VSCODE_VERSION`   | Override the VS Code version sent upstream.          |
| `MODEL_REASONING_EFFORT`   | Claude-side reasoning effort override.              |
| `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` | Route outbound GitHub/Copilot requests through an HTTP proxy. |
| `NO_PROXY`                 | Hosts that should bypass `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY`. |

Proxy example:

```sh
HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:7890 npx betahi-copilot-bridge@latest start
```

## Supported models

The bridge resolves aliases and clamps reasoning effort to what each model
accepts upstream.

### GPT-5 family — native Responses passthrough

| Model           | Reasoning efforts                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `gpt-5.6-luna`  | `none`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh` |
| `gpt-5.6-sol`   | `none`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh` |
| `gpt-5.6-terra` | `none`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh` |
| `gpt-5.5`       | `none`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh` |
| `gpt-5.4`       | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`         |
| `gpt-5.4-mini`  | `none`, `low`, `medium`                  |
| `gpt-5.3-codex` | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`         |
| `gpt-5-mini`    | `low`, `medium`, `high`                  |

### Claude family — translated to chat completions

| Model                            | Reasoning efforts                       | Notes                                  |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `claude-opus-4.8`                | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` |                                        |
| `claude-opus-4.8-1m`             | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` | 1M-token context window, prefer use `claude-opus-4.8-[1m]` in config. |
| `claude-opus-4.7`                | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` | Effort sent as `output_config.effort`. |
| `claude-opus-4.7-1m`             | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` | 1M-token context window, prefer use `claude-opus-4.7-[1m]` in config. |
| `claude-opus-4.6`                | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `max`          |                                        |
| `claude-opus-4.6-1m`             | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `max`          | 1M-token context window, prefer use `claude-opus-4.6-[1m]` in config              |
| `claude-sonnet-5`                | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` |                                        |
| `claude-sonnet-4.6`              | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `max`          |                                        |
| `claude-opus-4.5`                | —                                       | Reasoning not accepted upstream.       |
| `claude-sonnet-4.5`              | —                                       | Reasoning not accepted upstream.       |
| `claude-haiku-4.5`               | —                                       | Reasoning not accepted upstream.       |

For Claude Code settings, prefer `claude-opus-4.8-[1m]`,
`claude-opus-4.7-[1m]`, or `claude-opus-4.6-[1m]` when you want the CLI
`/context` UI and the upstream model to both use 1M context. Direct API clients
can use the corresponding model ids listed in the table.

### Gemini family — translated to chat completions

| Model                    | Aliases          |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- |
| `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` | `gemini-3.1-pro` |
| `gemini-3-flash-preview` | `gemini-3-flash` |
| `gemini-2.5-pro`         | —                |

### Legacy

`gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4o` — chat-only upstream, no reasoning parameter.

### Reasoning effort

For OpenAI-compatible clients, unsupported reasoning values are clamped to the
model capability table instead of being forwarded upstream. If a request omits
reasoning effort, the bridge leaves it omitted rather than inferring a default.
Claude-side reasoning can be set globally via `MODEL_REASONING_EFFORT` (env, or
`env` in `~/.claude/settings.json`); invalid Claude-side values are ignored,
and per-request `reasoning_effort` takes precedence.
Codex CLI does not accept `max` in `model_reasoning_effort`; when Codex config
contains `max`, the bridge writes `xhigh` and clamps it to the closest upstream
effort accepted by the selected model.

## Development

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) ≥ 1.2.

```sh
bun install
bun run dev          # watch mode against src/main.ts
bun test             # run all tests (bun test runner)
bun run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
bun run build        # produce dist/main.js with tsdown

# run directly from source (no build, no npx); --port specifies the port
bun run ./src/main.ts start --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4141 --no-prompt
```

Adding another CLI: drop a new translator under `src/bridges/<client>/`,
reuse `src/services/copilot/` for upstream calls, register routes in
`src/server.ts`, and add tests under `tests/`.
